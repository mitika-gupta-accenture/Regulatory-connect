# Pa11y

This is where you can run the pa11y automated tests locally.

## Running locally

1. Run the frontend by running `yarn dev` in the (`/form-base`) directory
2. `cd` out and navigate to the (`/pa11y`) directory
3. Run `yarn` to install required dependencies such as the pa11y library
4. Run the pa11y.js file by running this command in your terminal: `node pa11y.js`

This will then output the errors within a series of json files within the (`/pa11y`) directory
